Project by: Samuel Sunarjo

This directory contains all the networks I trained for this project. Each Jupyter notebook contains a network with a particular set of configuration. The configuration specifics are mentioned in the notebook name and in a docstring at the beginning of each notebook.

Most of the notebooks contain the outputs produced during training and testing, each in its own cell.
